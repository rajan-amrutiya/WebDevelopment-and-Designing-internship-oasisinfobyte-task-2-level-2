        <h1>Born on 31st October 1875 in the village of Nadiad in Gujarat, Vallabhbhai Patel was the fourth in a family of six children. Growing up in Karamsad under the care of his mother Ladba, he often joined his father Jhaverbhai, a farmer, in tilling the land. His father is said to have fought against the British in the army of the Rani of Jhansi in the Uprising of 1857. By the time Vallabhbhai was born, Jhaverbhai had settled into a quiet life of a peasant tilling the ten acres of his ancestral land that belonged to him. Vallabhbhai's mother Ladba was said to have been a very competent woman with a lovely voice. She gathered the children together in the courtyard every evening to sing devotional songs and narrate stories from the epics to them.  </h1>
        <h1>
        <h1>
       Although Vallabhbhai joined the village school as a boy, he learnt simple arithmetic and tables from his father whilst accompanying him to the fields. Curious to learn, he asked his teachers in school too many questions. Annoyed, they told him to learn for himself. Taking the cue, much of his learning was self-taught. Feeling the urge to study English, at the age of sixteen after completing his seventh grade in Gujarati, Vallabhbhai moved to Petlad, a small town seven miles from his home, for further studies as his hometown Karamsad did not have an English school. Pursuading six other boys from Karamsad to move with him, he rented a small house in Petlad where they cooked, shared chores and studied.
        </h1>
        <h1>
          At the age of 22, he completed his matriculation from Nadiad. Thereafter, he aspired to study in Bombay but life took him in another direction. 
          In the meantime, at the age of 16, he married Javerbai, a girl from a nearby village. Unfortunately, very little is known about Javerbai. Later, two children were born to them. Mani, a girl, born in 1904 and Dahya, a boy, born in 1906.

    <h2>Successful Lawyer

        </div>
        <h1>Passing his matriculation exams at the age of 22 in 1897, Patel desired to go to Bombay for further studies. However in order to shoulder his responsibilities toward his family, he decided to take up a job in a local lawyer's office where he had access to law books. Reading at home, he passed the District Pleader's Examination within a period of two years.</h1>
        <h1>Moving to the town of Godhra in 1900, Patel set up his legal practice there. Just as he was beginning to settle down, the Plague swept over vast areas of Gujarat and Patel himself contracted the disease while nursing a friend. Overcoming these hurdles and moving out of Godhra, he set up his practice in the town of Borsad where his brother Vithalbhai resided. There, he quickly ascended the ladder of success and soon became one of the most sought after criminal lawyers. </h1>
        <h1>Patel was known to be ruthless in his cross examination of witnesses. Once when he was in the midst of his cross examination in a case where his client was accused of a murder charge, Patel received a telegram informing him of his wife's death. Concealing his own anguish, Patel placed the telegram in his pocket and continued with the examination. He would not let his personal sorrow come in the way of his client's life.  </h1>
        <h1>In 1910, after having finally saved enough after years of hard work, Patel went to London to study for his Barristership at the age of 35 in fulfillment of a long cherished dream. There, he passed his final examination with a first class and an exemption of two terms thus completing within 30 months what should ordinarily have taken three years. He returned to India in 1913 and began to practice as a Barrister in Ahmedabad.</h1>
        <h1>His success at the Bar was remarkable. Within a period of six months, he became the leader of the Bar on the criminal side.But an ordinary event and an encounter with an extraordinary person, that were to occur soon thereafter, were about to dramatically turn around the direction of his life.   </h1>

      </div>
      <h1>In 1917, Patel was a successful barrister at the peak of his career. Dressed in fashionably cut suits, his days were busy defending his clients in the courtroom and the evenings were spent in the elite company of the members of the Gujarat Club in Ahmedabad where Patel enjoyed playing bridge and smoking his cigars. This proud and successful lawyer did not think much about a man called Gandhi who suddenly appeared to be in the limelight after having returned from South Africa. Patel called Gandhi a 'crank' when he first heard of his methods of ahimsa and satyagraha and scoffed at his ideas. </h1>
      <h1>One day Gandhi was invited to the Gujarat Club. Throngs of people crowed around to see him. Patel did not give Gandhi any attention and continued to be seated at his bridge table annoyed with the movement of people past his table.  When a friend asked Patel to join the others in listening to Gandhi, Patel sarcastically remarked 'I can tell you what he'll say. He will ask if you know how to sift pebbles from wheat. And that is supposed to bring independence.' But the scoffing was soon to give way to intrigue and the sarcasm was soon to turn into deep respect.</h1>
      <h1>In April 1917, Gandhi lent his support to workers of the indigo plantation in Champaran in Bihar. There, Gandhi organized a satyagraha for the peasants who were suppressed by the forceful plantation of indigo which were later forcibly bought at low prices. A famine had further added to the misery of the farmers. This satyagraha in Champaran had a profound effect on Patel. Subsequent to this event, Gandhi was invited to be the President of the Gujarat Sabha. Patel who was on the Executive Committee of the Sabha concurred immediately with the suggestion.</h1>

    <h2>Vallabhbhai Becomes Sardar

      </div>
      <h1>Patel had shed his persona of an English speaking wealthy barrister dressed in suit and hat and adopted khadi following in the footsteps of Gandhi. Soon after this transformation in 1918, Patel took the plunge into a life of public service, starting with the peasants' campaign in Kheda. The British administration had refused to entertain petitions from the peasants to defer the payment of tax in the area despite a failed crop. Gandhi was asked to lead the struggle and he picked Patel to be his second in command for the campaign. Joining his companions like Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya and Abbas Tyabji, Vallabhbhai Patel gathered villagers for a statewide revolt urging them to refuse payment of taxes.The Kheda campaign met with great success with the administration finally giving in to the peasants' demands. Patel became instantly a hero in the eyes of the peasants of Kheda.</h1>
      <h1>Ceasing his legal practice by 1920, Patel gave himself completely toward a life of public service. He worked for the empowerment of women and fought against alcoholism, untouchability and caste discrimination in Gujarat. He was elected Ahmedabadâ€™s Municipal President in the years 1922, 1924 and 1927 and succeeded in bringing about positive changes in Ahmedabad. He lead a satyagraha in Nagpur in the year 1923 against a law that sought to place a ban upon the raising of the Indian flag. During this period, he was elected President of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee.</h1>
      <h1>In 1928, Sardar moved his attention to the village of Bardoli in Gujarat, where a steep hike in taxes along with the predicament of a famine had caused large scale suffering. A campaign was initiated demanding a complete withdrawal of taxes. It was during this struggle that Sardar's astute leadership skills and organisational abilities came to the fore propelling him into national fame. For his remarkable contribution and leadership abilities, the peasants of Bardoli affectionately called him Sardar. From then on, it was by this name that be came to be known. </h1>

    <h2>Realising the dream of Independence

      <h1>In early 1947, British Prime Minister Clement Atlee announced that Britain would withdraw from India. It was a historic moment. In a statement made in the House of Commons in February 1947, Atlee said that His Majesty's Government wished to transfer power to responsible Indian hands by June 1948. The appointment of Lord Mountbatten as the New Viceroy in place of Lord Wavell was also made. Making a statement in June 1947, Lord Mountbatten advanced the date for the transfer of power from June 1948 to August 1947.</h1>
      <h1>To Patel and several others who had toiled to see the hour of freedom, the sweet dream of independence was finally within grasp. But the fruits of their labour were coming at a heavy price. Partition of India into two nations was looking increasingly unavoidable and though Patel had initially dismissed Jinnah's idea of Pakistan as a 'mad dream', he realised that he was going to have to swallow the bitter pill. </h1>
      <h1>Having realised thus the cherished dream of independence at the advanced age of 72, Patel did not consider rest or retirement. 'Let us not forget in this hour of joy the stupendous responsibilities and obligations which freedom brings in its wake' he said in a statement. 'Indeed there are enormous difficulties and insuperable obstacles in our way; but it is for us to overcome them.' </h1>

    <h2>Integration : His Greatest Legacy

      <h1>When the East India Company sunk its teeth into the Indian pie, the nawabs and rajas of Indian states were seen as strategic allies. The Company forced treaties upon the rulers of these states by which the Company was recognised as the paramount power. With the withdrawal of the British in August 1947, this paramouncy would lapse and the rulers of these Indian states would be free once again. About two fifths of the territory of India comprised Princely States. Some like Hyderabad and Kashmir were larger than several European countries. Others were tiny fiefdoms or jagirs comprising no more than a few villages. Together, there were 565 such states that were given the freedom to join either India or Pakistan or remain free after the midnight hour of 15th August, 1947. 
      </h1>
      <h1>On 27th June, 1947, less than two months before the hour of reckoning, a new States Department was set up under the charge of Sardar Patel to facilitate the task of accession of these princely states with the Dominion of India. Patel chose V.P. Menon as the Secretary of this Department. Together, they began the monumental task of piecing together the Indian nation. </h1>
      <h1>While some states like Bikaner and Baroda were quick to come on board, others like Kashmir and Manipur vascillated for months. Junagadh in the middle of Kathiawar acceded to Pakistan. Travancore declared its independence and Hyderabad, one of the richest Indian states situated in the heart of India wished to become a sovereign independent nation</h1>
      <h1>Sardar Patel foresaw in this chaos, the potential for civil war. The violence of Partition had created a deep sense of fear and distrust among the people. Wanting to avert anything that might endanger the unity and integrity of the young nation, Patel began at the age of 72, to take charge of this challenging task. Nowhere else in the world had a nation been integrated from such a varied diverse population in such a short span of time.  But Sardar was not a man to be defeated by challenges.</h1>
      <h1>Patiently and untiringly, Patel, Menon and their team began the process by which 565 princely states were integrated into the Union of India. The geography of India would have been dangerously different but for their stellar foresight and remarkable contribution. This was Patel's most lasting legacy toward the nation he gave his life for. </h1>

  <h2>The Twilight Years

    <h1>At the time of Independence, Patel was 72. Before he took up the task of Accession and Integration of the Princely States, his health had begun deteriorating and he had been advised to take complete rest. Yet, as a member of the first Cabinet of free India, he readily took charge of three ministries - Home, States and Information. In addition to this, he was also Deputy Prime Minister of India. During this period, whenever Nehru travelled abroad, Patel also shouldered the responsibility of being Acting Prime Minister. When V.P. Menon, Secretary of the States Department conveyed to Patel at the time of independence that having achieved the dream of freedom, he would have liked to retire, Patel said to him that this was no time to rest or retire as the young nation needed his services. Patel too kept aside concerns of advancing age and ill-health to rise to the challenge of building a strong independent India.</h1>
    <h1>In addition to these responsibilities as a Minister, Patel was also a member of the Constituent Assembly that was preparing a draft Constitution for the nascent nation. In this connection, he was the Chairman of the Minorities sub-committee of the Assembly and he was concerned with abolishing the many differences that existed between the various people of India seeking that they all unite as a single community of Indians.</h1>
    <h1>As Minister in charge of the States Department, Patel shouldered the monumental task of bringing together 565 princely states and integrating their administration, their military and systems into the Union of India. He travelled extensively to meet with the rajas and nawabs, conducted dozens of meetings for negotiations and wrote hundreds of letters. On one such trip to Jaipur, his plane met with an accident and Patel had a narrow escape.</h1>
    <h1>The death of Gandhi, his mentor and guide, in January 1948 came as a deep shock to Patel. He suffered a heart attack in March 1948. Upon regaining consciousness soon thereafter, Patel said 'I was on my way to Bapu. Why did you stop me?' underlying his deep attachment to Gandhi. After that, he would be heard saying ' Well, I know the final call is coming to join Bapu but I must work while I can for the country.In November 1950, Patel fell severely ill from an intestinal disorder and high blood pressure. He was flown to Bombay for further treatment where his daughter Maniben nursed him with great devotion. But he suffered a stroke and on the early hours of 15th December, 1950, the Iron Man of India closed his eyes for the last time. The President of India, Rajendra Prasad, the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and many other leaders flew into Bombay for Patel's funeral where a six mile long procession awaited to pay homage to one of India's tallest leaders. The last rites were performed by Dahyabhai, Patel's son in the crematorium in Queens Road in Bombay.</h1>
    <h1>'What inspiration, courage, confidence and force incarnate Vallabhbhai was! We will not see the like of him again' said C. Rajagopalachari paying a fitting tribute to the Iron Man of India. Maulana Azad spoke of Patel's valour as high as the mountains and his determination as strong as steel.</h1>
    <h1>'History' said Nehru speaking of Sardar, 'will call him the builder and consolidator of the new India'. </h1>
